##Abstract

It is non-practical to do computation on a single machine for Big Data applications. Likewise, it is also non-practical to train machine learning algorithms using large datasets on a single machine. One of the widely used Deep Learning framework TensorFlow supports distributed learning. In this paper, Distributed TensorFlow's architecture will be explained.
